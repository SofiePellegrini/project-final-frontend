Final Project

We created a plant/garden planner. Itâ€™s main purpose is to keep track of your plants by adding them to your profile. You can add your own information about your plant and also add a picture of your plant.
There is also a calendar where you can add tasks that you have to do with your plants.
We also made it a PWA so you can access it in your phone as an app.
